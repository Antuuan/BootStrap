        <br><br>The F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles). Used by Nasa for testing new Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzles (P/YBBN) and advanced control-logic programming. It also served as a testbed for high altitude instrumentation. Though never made it into service it served a major role in the developement of the F-22 Raptor

            Early Developement
          </h3>
    
          <p2>
            In the early 1970s, the beggining of the F15 ACTIVE program, at the time still named the STOL/MTD used 2D thrust vectoring nozzles and no active canards which were added on later during developement along with the 3D thrust vectoring nozzles. Both the trust vectoring and active canards allows for better maneuverability at both high and low speeds.
